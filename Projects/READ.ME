# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Machine Learning.  
The goal is to explore which factors influenced survival (e.g., age, gender, class) and to train a predictive model.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Features include:
  - Passenger Class
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarked Port
- Target: **Survived** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, etc.)

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression)  
4. Model Evaluation  

## 📈 Results
- Achieved accuracy: ~80%  
- Females had a much higher surival rate than males
